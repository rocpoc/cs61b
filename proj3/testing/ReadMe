The testing makefile in this directory is set up to allow you to substitute
selected staff packages (graph, trip, or make) for your own in order to test
your packages in isolation.  

* To check your make and trip packages against the staff graph package,
  use the command

       make GRAPHPACK=staff check

* To check your graph package against the staff make and trip packages, use

       make TRIPPACK=staff MAKEPACK=staff check

These parameters to make also work for make-check and trip-check and also
when running 'make check' in the outer proj3 directory, the proj3/make
directory or the proj3/trip directory.  You can even check the staff
implementation against itself (and your own tests) with

       make GRAPHPACK=staff MAKEPACK=staff TRIPPACK=staff check

These options will work on the instructional machines. On your home
machine, you can copy ~cs61b/lib/staff-graph.jar, ~cs61b/lib/staff-
make.jar, and ~cs61b/lib/staff-trip.jar into your testing directory
(or your proj3 directory).  The .jar files are also available in 
cs61b-software, and the makefile will find them automatically if you use 
our default login scripts, which define MASTERDIR to be $HOME/cs61b-software.
