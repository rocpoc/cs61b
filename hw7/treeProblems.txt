1. Give a formula for the exact height of a binary search tree (as you
   implemented in homework 6) as a function of N if we insert N values in
   increasing order.

   LogN




2. Give a formula for the exact height of a 2-4 tree in terms of N if 
   we insert N values in increasing order.

    LogN
