1. Quicksort, BSTs, Mergesort

a. List all comparisons performed by Quicksort when sorting [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 4, 6] using the stable partitioning procedure described in class. The answers for the first partitioning operation are provided for you. The order for which pair does not matter (either 5-3 or 3-5 is fine). You may find running the provided Quicksort class to be useful. 

5-3, 5-2, 5-1, 5-7, 5-8, 5-4, 5-6, 3-2, 3-1, 3-4, 2-1, 7-8, 7-6


b. List all comparisons performed when inserting [5, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 4, 6] into a BST. Give your comparisons in the order they occur. The first few have been provided for you:

5-3, 5-2, 3-2, 5-1, 3-1, 2-1, 5-7, 5-8, 7-8, 5-4, 3-4, 5-6, 7-6


c. What do you observe about the set of comparisons performed by Quicksort vs. BST insertion?

They just use a different order for comparison



d. True or false: Suppose we have an array x which, when inserted into a BST from x[0..], results in a bushy BST. For any such array x, quicksorting x using the leftmost item as a pivot and the partitioning algorithm from part a will always be fast (i.e. N log N time instead of N^2).
True

e. Give an example of a comparison performed by Mergesort that is not given in your answers to 1a or 1b.
